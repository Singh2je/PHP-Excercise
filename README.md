This project is to get a basic understanding of php.

We have the following components

1) HTML file: A data is submitted into the form. Data gets saved in the URL.
2) PHP file: This file grabs that data from the URL , and runs a function on that params.




GET Method: shows up in the URL

POST Method: does not. Better for sensitive data, you don't want passwords to show up in the URL's.
